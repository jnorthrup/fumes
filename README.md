Elite Dangerous non-refuelling route spacer

what if you could pilot an all-out engineered combat ship in Elite Dangerous further than your class 4 tank will normally take you in under 30 jumps?
Bring along every module crucial to the destination going in hot-- and the best part is you can skip the distractions at carriers and stations to drop 
armor, add fuel scoops, only to sit idle at a nearby port while your armor catches up with you?

Coming in Spring 2023 to theaters everywhere, the EDMC plugin absolutely noone is asking for... Fumes!
