Elite Dangerous non-refuelling route spacer

what if you could pilot an all-out engineered combat ship in Elite Dangerous further than your class 4 tank will normally take you in under 30 jumps?
Bring along every module crucial to the destination going in hot-- and the best part is you can skip the distractions at carriers and stations to drop 
armor, add fuel scoops, only to recirocate all this effort yet again once you are  done waiting for your priceless hull points and engineered shields to catch up?

Coming in Spring 2023 to theaters everywhere, the EDMC plugin absolutely noone is asking for... Fumes!
